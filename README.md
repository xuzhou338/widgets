# My Code Snippets

This repository contains code snippets (code and examples of usage) that I write for practice, for fun, or to serve certain projects.

The names and descriptions are shown below:

- `statistics_from_scratch.py`: It contains some frequently-used statistical functions sucha as mean, median, mode... interquartile range... binomial distributions, normal distributions, poisson distributions. I wrote them only by using only Python standard libraries, including math and collections. The goal of this is for practicing.
- `mysql_io.py`: A module that I packaged using [mysql.connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/) to connect Python and MySQL in order to import and outport data. The initial goal was to automate the process of importing Leetcode SQL test cases (in dictionary form) into MySQL so that I can test my SQL code on my local machine. Right now, the `MysqlIO` class supports exporting MySQL tables as `pandas.DataFrame`, importing `pandas.DataFrame` into MySQL as tables, as well as automatically handling the Leetcode test cases in dictionary forms. The example of using it can be found here: [mysql_io_example.ipynb](example/mysql_io_example.ipynb)
- `tree.py`: It contains tree related functionalities. Right now it includes `BinaryTreeNode` class for binary tree construction and two functions: `bt_from_list` (build binary tree from list) and `max_depth` (find the maximum depth of the tree using BFS, see more about [algorithms](https://github.com/xuzhou338/ds-tools/tree/master/algorithm_problems#max_depth))
- `EDA.py`: Self-written useful functions for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- `confusion_matrix.py`: Modified confusion-matrix-related function from sklearn and added support for thresholds.
- `model_eval.py`: Functions to be used in model evaluations.

- `nav.bash`: Bash file that can navigate to different directories from anywhere.
- `.bash_profile`: Setting file that contains my common alias, and also conda settings
- `.zshrc`: Setting file that contains zsh settings and at the very end, has command to automatically run bash_profile from zsh.
